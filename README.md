Group Memeber: Prashant Kumar(11840820), Ram Tiwari(11840890), Saurav Raj(11841020), Mohit Sharma(11840730)

We designed a python program to find slots for a extra class of a particular course in a particular fractal considering the time table, enrolled students in the course,
availabilty of professor and availability of room.

In output, we are providing the day, slot no. and also available room for the extra class.

Note:
1) Run the Extra_Slot.py python file.
2) There are two input given by user:

   Input1 -> Input current running fractal (e.g: "2"). We have 6 fractal, so enter a number between 1-6.
   
   Input2 -> Input course code for which extra class is required(e.g: "CS301 (16)")
3) Open sample.png file to see the output sample.
